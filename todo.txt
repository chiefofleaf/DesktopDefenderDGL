todo:

what am i?
	inspired by arcade game "Asteroids" (1979) in display style, movement and objective
	-display style
		vector graphic
		simple polygons for everything
	-movement and control
		no friction; object moves -> keeps moving; object spins -> keeps spinning
		object is pushed or hit -> velocity changes
		
		at least two styles of controlling i can think of off the top of my head
			1:  one dedicated button for accelerating in direction of orientation
				and two buttons for changing angular velocity (one for either direction, obviously)
			2:  there are two thrusters on each side of the ship
				one button controls one thruster. if only one thruster thrusts, then thrust is unbalanced
				and the ship rotates, but also accelerates in direction of orientation.
		
		either i have to decide for one of the two styles, or implement both and make them switchable.
		
		player can shoot. (pew pew). maybe bullets or radioactive bullets or cool lazer or explosive rockets or-
	-objective
		the objective of asteroids is not dying and achieving a high score.
		i think that's a good objective, so i might borrow it,
		but adding additional features to make it my own, of course.
